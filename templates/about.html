            Hi! My name is Kevin Moy, and I’m a junior majoring in computer science and data science at UC Berkeley.

            The inherent feeling of fulfillment and satisfaction I get from helping others led me to seek many different teaching jobs.
            This ranges from chess to teaching computer science at Cal.
            I’ve published some of the notes/observations/articles/rants I’ve written on this site over time.

            Chess has been a love of mine since the age of six, 
            and have developed myself into a certified Candidate Master with USCF rating 2184. 
            Teaching chess, as well as directing chess tournaments, are two professions I’ve had for over six years.

            I have two principles that I firmly believe in and always will:
            <ol>
                <li>We learn best by example and visualization- and being able to relate and associate with the information presented.</li>
                <li>We can model, simulate, and emulate anything humans can do with a carefully crafted program.</li>
            </ol>
            I will do my best to show this with the content on my site.
